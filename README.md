# Comparty Bot

## What about the project?
The main idea of the bot is to help manage chat for admins and rating count (for fun purposes or not).

## What it can do?
- Ban and mute with commands
- Report on the message by mentioning every admin of the channel
- Auto-ban user according to CAS and specified stop words by join request or link in a message
- Count user rating using user message triggers (with cooldown for user)

## Incoming release features
- Localization
- Exponential rating cooldown
- Deeper configuration options for admin
- Throttle user requests to the bot in the chat
